## Exploit
We can see that most page are fetch with the query "?page=".<br>
This makes the application possibly vulnerable to a Directory Traversal attack if the value is not well validated.<br>
We look for the common "/etc/passwd" file.<br>
`/?page=../../../../../../../etc/passwd`<br>
gives us the flag.

## Patch
- Input Validation with sanitization or whitelisting
- File Permission: Use the principle of least privilege for the user running the application, so it only has access to the files and directories it needs.
- Avoid Direct User Input in File Paths:  if users are uploading files, store them in a dedicated directory with names generated by your system, rather than user-provided names.
